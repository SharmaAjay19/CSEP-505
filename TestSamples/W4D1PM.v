(A) Given a program, define a transition system for it by answering
    the 3 questions:
      (1) What are the states?
      (2) What are the initial states?
      (3) What is the transition relation?

(B) Figure out what you want to prove about all the reachable states
    of the system.

(C) The property from (B) is usually not inductive, so figure out a
    *stronger* property that IS inductive an prove that using
    "invariant_induction".

(D) Come back and finish the proof for (B) using "invariant_implies".
