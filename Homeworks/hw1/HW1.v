(*
 * This homework assignment is a tutorial introduction to Coq.
 *
 * Set up Coq as described in README.md. Then step through this file with VSCode
 * (or another IDE for Coq), and complete the problems. Search for "PROBLEM" to
 * be sure you find them all---not all problems correspond to Coq code!
 *
 * Throughout, we include the approximate lines of code (LOC) or number of
 * tactics for each of our solutions to these problems.  These are rough
 * guidelines to help you figure out if you are getting off track.
 *
 * There is no penalty for writing a shorter or longer solution! However, if
 * you find yourself writing a much longer solution, you might save yourself
 * some time by taking a step back and seeing if you can find a simpler way.
 *
 * Every problem on this homework is designed to be conceptually
 * straightforward; the hard part is just getting up to speed on Coq.
 *
 * There are 9 problems worth a total of 50 points.
 *
 * See the bottom of README.md for quite a bit more information, including some
 * advice on how to do this homework, how this homework will be graded, and a
 * list of tactics used in our solution.
 *)

(* --- Setting up Coq --- *)

(*
 * PROBLEM 1 [0 points, ~1 LOC]
 * Set up Coq as described in README.md
 *
 * Once Coq is installed according to directions, you should be able to step
 * through this entire file in your IDE.
 *
 * We will always have a non-problem PROBLEM 1, because Gradescope makes the
 * autograder results "Problem 1" :)
 *
 * You've heard of computer scientists counting from zero, but have you heard of
 * them counting from two?!
 *)

(* infer type arguments *)
Set Implicit Arguments.

(* --- Boolean practice --- *)

(* Here are some definitions about booleans from lecture.  *)

Inductive bool : Type :=
| true : bool
| false : bool.

Definition notb (b : bool) : bool :=
  match b with
  | true => false
  | false => true
  end.

Definition andb (b1 : bool) (b2 : bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => b2
  | false => false
  end.


(*
 * PROBLEM 2 [4 points, ~5 LOC]
 * Write a function called `orb` that implements boolean disjunction.
 *
 * Hint: Kinda like `andb`, but different.
 *)
Definition orb (b1 : bool) (b2 : bool) : bool :=
  match b1 with
  | true => true
  | false => b2
  end.


(*
 * Remember that `Compute` just runs programs.
 * We can use it for simple testing.
 *)
Compute orb true true.   (* should be true. *)
Compute orb true false.  (* should be true. *)
Compute orb false true.  (* should be true. *)
Compute orb false false. (* should be false. *)


(*
 * PROBLEM 3 [4 points, ~15 tactics]
 * Prove the following theorem, that `orb` is commutative.
 *
 * Hint: Kinda like `andb_comm` from lecture.
 * Hint: You may need fewer tactics if you use semicolon chains.
 *)
Lemma orb_comm :
  forall b1 b2,
    orb b1 b2 = orb b2 b1.
Proof.
  intro b1. intro b2.
  destruct b1.
  - simpl.
    destruct b2.
    + simpl. reflexivity.
    + simpl. reflexivity.
  - destruct b2.
    + simpl. reflexivity.
    + simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.


(*
 * PROBLEM 4 [4 points, ~7 tactics]
 * Prove the following theorem about `notb`, `orb`, and `andb`.
 *
 * Hint: You may need fewer tactics if you use semicolon chains.
 * Hint: All these proofs start to look the same after a while...
 *)
Lemma notb_andb_is_orb_notb :
  forall b1 b2,
    notb (andb b1 b2) = orb (notb b1) (notb b2).
Proof.
  intro b1. intro b2.
  destruct b1.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.


(* --- Natural numbers practice --- *)

(*
 * Here are some more definitions from lecture,
 * this time about natural numbers.
 *)

Inductive nat : Type :=
| O : nat
| S : nat -> nat.

Fixpoint add (n1 : nat) (n2 : nat) : nat :=
  match n1 with
  | O => n2
  | S m1 => S (add m1 n2)
  end.


(*
 * PROBLEM 5 [4 points, ~4 tactics]
 * Prove the following theorem about add.
 *
 * Hint: Do you think you'll need induction? Hmm...
 *)
Lemma add_S_n :
  forall n1 n2,
    add (S n1) n2 = S (add n1 n2).
Proof.
  intro n1. intro n2.
  simpl. reflexivity.
Qed.


(*
 * PROBLEM 6 [8 points, ~1 sentences]
 * Consider the following theorem, superficially similar to the previous one.
 *
 * The problem below asks you to prove it, but before that, describe here
 * whether you expect it to be less difficult than, more difficult than,
 * or about the same difficulty as the previous theorem.
 *
 * Please explain your answer in 1 to 2 sentences, using your mental model
 * for what kinds of things different tactics are good at.
 *
 * Hint: If you don't know, it's okay to try to prove it (the next problem
 *       below), and then come back and explain the outcome.
 *)
Lemma add_n_S :
  forall n1 n2,
    add n1 (S n2) = S (add n1 n2).
Proof.
Abort.
  (*This will be more difficult to prove compared to the previous theorem since the pattern matching in our add function above is done for the first argument n1 and not the second argument n2. So, just simplification and reflexivity won't work here.*)


(*
 * PROBLEM 7 [8 points, ~8 tactics]
 * Now go ahead and prove the theorem from the previous problem
 * (restated below).
 *
 * Hint: You may need fewer tactics than we did if you use semicolon chains.
 *
 * Hint: Do you think you'll need induction? Hmm...
 *)
Lemma add_n_S :
  forall n1 n2,
    add n1 (S n2) = S (add n1 n2).
Proof.
  intro n1. intro n2.
  induction n1 as [| p IHp].
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite IHp. reflexivity.
Qed.


(*
Added this Lemma from the lectures to use in Problem 8 rewrite.
*)
Lemma add_n_O (n: nat) :
    add n O = n.
Proof.
  induction n as [| p IHp].
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite IHp. reflexivity.
Qed.

(*
 * PROBLEM 8 [15 points, ~20 tactics]
 * Prove the following theorem about add.
 *
 * Hint: Proceed by induction.
 *
 * Hint: Don't forget to reuse previously proved Lemmas by using
 *       the `rewrite` tactic.
 *
 * Hint: It's okay to copy-paste lemmas we proved in lecture if you need them.
 *)
Lemma add_comm :
  forall n1 n2,
    add n1 n2 = add n2 n1.
Proof.
  intro n1. intro n2.
  induction n1 as [| p IHp].
  - simpl. rewrite add_n_O. reflexivity.
  - simpl. rewrite IHp. rewrite add_n_S. reflexivity.
Qed.

(*
 * PROBLEM 9 [3 points, ~3 sentences]
 *
 * Please take a moment to let us know how the homework went for you by
 * answering the following three questions:
 *    1. How long did the homework take you?
 *    2. Which parts were most interesting or helpful for you?
 *    3. Which parts were especially frustrating, confusing, or tedious?
 *       What should we do better next time?
 *
 * It's fine if your answers are short if you don't have much to say!
 *)

(* Your feedback here! *)
(* 
      1. Roughly 2 hours.
      2. Problem 7 and 8 were the most interesting as well has helpful since it required some reading through Coq documentation and learning new ways of writing proofs.
      3. Nothing in particular felt frustrating or confusing. The directions and expectation were pretty clear.
*)

(*
 * This is the end of Homework 1.  It's never too early to get started on
 * Homework 2!

 * README.md file in this directory.
